# FEHeroes

This repository details a personal project I have been working on aiming to gain insight on character data from the popular mobile gacha game *Fire Emblem: Heroes*.

Current progress on this project as of now:

- [x] Working script to scrape data from gamepedia.com
- [x] Visualizations on character data
- [x] Analysis on Legendary Heroes
- [ ] Analysis on Power Creep
- [ ] Create model for predicting tier (add feature for dancer)
    - Add feature for dancer

Considerations for improvement of current project:

- Change the format of the data into JSON so that stat variances and skills can be included
- Improve visualizations

Source data comes from the website www.gamepedia.com. Characters belong to Intelligent Systems.
