# FEHeroes

This repository details a personal project I have been working on aiming to gain insight on character data from the popular mobile gacha game *Fire Emblem: Heroes*.

Current progress on this project as of now:

- [x] Working script to scrape data from gamepress.gg
- [x] Visualizations on character data
- [x] Analysis on Legendary Heroes
- [x] Create model for predicting tier

Considerations for improvement/additions to current project:

- Change the format of the data into JSON so that stat variances and skills can be included
- Improve visualizations
- Analysis on Power Creep
- Create a classifier to classify different characters - can it classify movement type?

Source data comes from the websites https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Main_Page and https://gamepress.gg/c/fire-emblem-heroes. Characters belong to Intelligent Systems.
